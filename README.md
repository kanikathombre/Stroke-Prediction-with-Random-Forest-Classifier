# Stroke-Prediction-with-Random-Forest-Classifier
This project uses a stroke prediction dataset to build and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier.
Key steps include:

EDA: Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
Dataset Splits: Train-test splits of 60-40 and 70-30.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with three combinations of estimators and jobs.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess accuracy, MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
Plots: Visualize performance variations:
Accuracy vs. train-test splits.
MSE, RMSE, MAE vs. train-test splits.
MSE, RMSE, MAE vs. estimators and jobs.
